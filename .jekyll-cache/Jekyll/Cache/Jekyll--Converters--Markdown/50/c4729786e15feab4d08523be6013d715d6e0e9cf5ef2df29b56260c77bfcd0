I"â<p>Linear codes were developed as a means to enable the correction of errors induced in the streaming of data. They are defined by their property that any linear sum of messages results in a message. These codes can be broken into two types - block codes and convolutional codes. This library focuses on code construction as it relates to block codes.</p>
